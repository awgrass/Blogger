# simple_blog

This is a basic blog site I implemented while attending a Udacity course. 
My intention was to learn more about the web and its development, moreover to get known to the tools used in modern implementations. 

The whole backend was done in python2.7, using the webapp2 and jinja2 frameworks.
I worked with cookies, database queries, password hashing and salting, cache performance improvements and more, just to name a few patterns.

The blog relies on google app engine. So if you want to have a deeper insight you should get app engine. I highly recommend it, not just because it's free, but also it's ease in use.
